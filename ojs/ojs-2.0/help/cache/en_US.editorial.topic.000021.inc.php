The extent of the review process, including which journal sections have a peer review conducted on the submissions and how many reviewers are used, is spelled out in the journal\'s Review Policy prepared by the Editors and Journal Manager. When a Section Editor or an Editor clicks on a submission title in the In Review Queue, they are taken to the submission\'s Review page, where the peer review is conducted and editorial decision reached for the item. If the Section Editor accepts a submission for publication, it then moves to the In Editing queue. If the submission is declined, it is moved to the Archives.</p>',
